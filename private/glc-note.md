# An emotional goodbye:

Hey,

You reading this may know me as one of many aliases but the two I used the most are immortal-miku, MeltingAlice. I am a 15 year old girl who has been trying to distance myself from this friendgroup (which I call the GLC Group) for a long time. I dont hate y'all, but y'all def hate me after all I've done to distance myself from you guys, but I guess it ended up working.

I feel really bad about how many people I hurt, about all the people I hurt, about how many bridges were burned, and I really am sorry. I feel a large amount of remorse for the many things I have done throughout my distancing period.

There are likely many accusations towards me in this current time, and I know some people would probably like answers. I do not know of them, but if you contact me I'll either directly confirm or deny them. I am no longer going to hide anything, but I do not want to be associated with this group any longer, so please do not DM me if possible, or unless strictly necessary.

contact me at accusations@alicesworld.tech. I will be checking this email regularly until a certain date, of which I am unsure of at this current time, though if I stop responding and you have further questions, email me at alice@alicesworld.tech.

You people have heavily influenced me during my most vurnrable years, I have many people I would like to thank, think of this as the end credits of 「Alice's GLC Saga: The Villain」:

Thank you Chloe for being my friend until the end (end being about now), I know you wont see me the same way ever again, and thats fine, but I want you to know I'll miss you.


I'm sorry Crin for the damage I caused, I hurt you immensely, but I hope you are in a better place now.


Thanks AlexCDG for being the reason I learned JS and fucked with the discord API. I'm sorry for stealing your bot but hey you can take it back now!


Thanks Loffs for uh,,,, Roblox speedrun


Thanks Bingable for being a real OG, you were super cool.

Goodbye
